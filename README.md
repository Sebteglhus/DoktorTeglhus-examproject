In the current version of this application, it most likely will not be able to run. This is due to the redaction of several aspects of the code due to safety concerns.

Furthermore, this code was developed as part as a class on basic application development, and is therefore meant as a demonstration of skill, and not as a serious application.

To use this application, the external modules must be installed. As these are stored by name in package-lock.json,
one can install these by entering "npm i" in the terminal of the code editor.

Login-credentials to get started can be found in the report, and will not be stored here.
However, these cannot be used in the current iteration, as the database isn't currently valid, due to security concerns.
